# Credit-card-default
A dataset that we have is from a Taiwanese bank that contains information on 30000 clients, including their payment details and demographic details. The goal is to evaluate whether or not a particular client will have a credit card default next month by applying different classification machine learning techniques. On top of that, we are about to delve into the dataset and uncover some factors that are hidden in the dataset, i.e. the factors that might not seem very important, but play a major role in the classification of the data.
